# Lift-and-shift-application-workload-on-AWS
Lift the existing tech stack and host it on AWS cloud with proper load balancing and DNS configuration.

## Overview 
In this project i have hosted the entire stack of the vprofile project and hosted it no AWS for production workload. If we look at the scenario there are lot of services running in tandem so that the service properly delivered to the customer. Managing these services requires huge expenditure, time and resources.
To tackle this problem we can host the entire technology stack on AWS using its IaaS capabilities. We pay as we go, automation is easy, human errors can be avoided and flexibilty will be available.
